# Stabilizer
A simple [Deli](https://github.com/Deli-Collective/Deli) plugin that allows you to two-hand-stabilize while holding any object in your offhand. The vanilla game only allows two-hand-stabilizing while not holding anything, or holding a flashlight or magazine.

Requires [BepInEx](https://github.com/BepInEx/BepInEx) 5.4.x and [Deli](https://github.com/Deli-Collective/Deli) 0.3.x. Place the Stabilizer.deli file into the H3VR/Deli/mods folder.
